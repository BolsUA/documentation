# Definition of Ready

The Definition of Ready (DoR) sets the criteria that a task or user story must meet before the development team can start work. It ensures all necessary details are provided, allowing the team to begin with clarity and confidence. By following the DoR, the development process is streamlined, leading to better software quality.

### User Stories:

Our user stories have the characteristics defined by the INVEST model:
- Independent
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimable
- Small
- Testable

### Estimated Costs:

We decided to use the fibonacci sequence to estimate the costs of the user stories.

| Story Points | Effort Required     | Time Required   |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1            | Minimal effort      | A few minutes   |
| 2            | Minor effort        | A few hours     |
| 3            | Moderate effort     | One day         |
| 5            | Considerable effort | A few days      |
| 8            | Significant effort  | One week        |
| 13           | Maximum effort      | Up to one month |

Our backlog is prioritized, with the highest-value items for the user placed at the top. As a result, our sprints focus on addressing the most important tasks available at the front of the backlog.
