# Definition of Ready

The Definition of Ready (DoR) sets the criteria that a task or user story must meet before the development team can start work. It ensures all necessary details are provided, allowing the team to begin with clarity and confidence. By following the DoR, the development process is streamlined, leading to better software quality.

### User Stories:

Our user stories have the characteristics defined by the **INVEST** model:

- #### Independent
  The story can be developed and delivered without relying on other user stories.
- #### Negotiable
   The story is not fixed or rigid. It’s a starting point for discussion between the customer (or Product Owner) and the development team
- #### Valuable
   The story must be easy to estimate in terms of effort and time. This helps prioritize it effectively. Stories that are valuable but too time-consuming may need to be reconsidered
- #### Estimable
   The story must be easy to estimate in terms of effort and time. This helps prioritize it effectively. Stories that are valuable but too time-consuming may need to be reconsidered.
- #### Small
   For two-week sprints, the story should take no more than 3–4 days to complete, including everything required to reach a “done” state
- #### Testable
   The story must have clear acceptance criteria, so it can be tested to confirm it meets the requirements

### Acceptance Criteria
The Acceptance Criteria must present a specific format of: <br />
- **Given** &lt;Context&gt;, **When** &lt;action&gt;, **Then** &lt;result&gt;

### Estimated Costs:

We decided to use the fibonacci sequence to estimate the costs of the user stories.

| Story Points | Effort Required     | Time Required   |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1            | Minimal effort      | A few minutes   |
| 2            | Minor effort        | A few hours     |
| 3            | Moderate effort     | One day         |
| 5            | Considerable effort | A few days      |
| 8            | Significant effort  | One week        |
| 13           | Maximum effort      | Up to one month |

Our backlog is prioritized, with the highest-value items for the user placed at the top. As a result, our sprints focus on addressing the most important tasks available at the front of the backlog.
