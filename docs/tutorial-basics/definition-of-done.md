# Definition of Done

The Definition of Done (DoD) outlines the criteria that must be met for a product increment, like a user story, to be considered complete and ready for release. It ensures all acceptance criteria are fulfilled, helping the team deliver high-quality software and preventing incomplete work from being included in the final increment.

### Our Definition of Done includes the following criteria:
- Meets the acceptance criteria
- Successfully passes the implemented tests
- Code is reviewed and approved by another team member
- Documentation is updated to reflect the changes
