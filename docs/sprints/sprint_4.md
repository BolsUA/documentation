## Sprint Retrospective

During most of this sprint period, our team was unable to make progress on the project due to another academic commitments from other curricular units. However, towards the end of the sprint, we managed to achieve a significant milestone by successfully deploying our current solution to AWS. While the team focused most of their capacity on other academic obligations, we were able to conclude the sprint with this important deployment accomplishment.
