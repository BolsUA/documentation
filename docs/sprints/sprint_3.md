## Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well
- **MVP** - We decided that for some parts of the project we do not have time to implement all the features, so we decided to discard the part of the proposal workflow that the secretary has to approve, so now the proposal will automatically become a scholarship. So we can focus on the most important parts of the project. We also used this sprint to reduce our technical debt, so we can have a better codebase for the next sprints.

### What Could Be Improved
- **Time Management** - We had some problems with time management, since our team is very busy with other curricular units, so it made us have some problems working on this sprint.
