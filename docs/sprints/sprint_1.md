## Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well
- **Communication**: When we did meet, our discussions were clear, and collaboration was productive. We efficiently divided responsibilities and supported each other.
- **Learning Opportunities**: Throughout the sprint, we gained valuable knowledge, particularly around problem-solving and adjusting to challenges, which will help us in the next sprint.

### What Could Be Improved
- **Steady Progress**: As shown in our burndown chart, we struggled to maintain consistent progress throughout the sprint. There were periods of inactivity, leading to a significant rise in remaining work. 
- **Consistency in Group Meetings**: Irregular meetings caused delays in task completion and coordination. We need more frequent check-ins to stay aligned and avoid accumulating work.
- **Time Management**: Balancing this project with other course work proved difficult for some of us. We need to plan better, ensuring that enough time is dedicated to completing sprint goals on time.
