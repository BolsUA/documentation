## Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well
- **Sprint Start**: We began implementing each user story at the start of the sprint, which allowed us to identify potential issues early on and adjust our approach accordingly.
- **Communication**: We maintained regular communication throughout the sprint, which helped us stay aligned and address any blockers promptly.

### What Could Be Improved
- **Task Estimation**: We underestimated the complexity of some user stories, which led to a lower number of completed story points than expected.
