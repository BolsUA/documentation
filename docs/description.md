# Project Description

The "BolsUA" project is designed for the University of Aveiro. The main goal is to improve the current system of posting scholarships and applications for them.

The current system uses the news page to advertise scholarships, which does not have a search system, making it difficult to find scholarships that are of interest to the student.
As for the application process, the necessary documents are scattered across different websites, and the submittion process is made by email, which can be confusing and time-consuming.

The project aims to create a platform where students can search for scholarships that are of interest to them, and where new scholarships can be easily posted and managed by the university staff.
The application process will be simplified, with all the necessary documents being uploaded directly to the platform.
